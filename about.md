title: About Me Back-End Developer
permalink: /about/
---

I have been working as a developer since 2002 now and have strong experience in C#, Haskell, C/C++, Assembler programming languages. Also, I have shallow experience in PHP, CSS, HTML, HTML5 markup languages and style sheets. Although I have skills in a front-end development, I have strong predilection for back-end development. In fact, my experience in front-end development was occasional even though I have good grasp of this domain too. My usual way of addressing a task is a real practical programming. I like to appraise a theory if it is a part of an ongoing practical task.
