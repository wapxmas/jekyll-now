title: About Me Back-End Developer
permalink: /about/
---

I have been working as a software developer since 2002 now and have strong experience in C#, Haskell, C/C++, Java, and Assembler programming language. Also, I have deep enough experience in a front-end development, namely PHP, HTML(5), and CSS. Although I have skills in a front-end development, I have strong predilection for a back-end development. In fact, my experience in a front-end development was occasional even though I have good grasp of this domain too. My usual way of addressing a task is a real practical programming. I like to appraise a theory if it is a part of an ongoing practical task.
