I have been working as a developer since 2002 now. I have strong experience in C#, Haskell, C/C++, Assembler programming languages, also I have shallow experience in PHP, CSS, Html, Html5 markup languages and style sheets. Although I have skills in a front-end development, I have strong predilection for back-end development. Moreover, my experience in front-end development was occasional, however not to say I have good knowledge in this area of development. My usual way of addressing a task is a real practical programming. I like to grasp a theory if it is a part of a ongoing practical task.
